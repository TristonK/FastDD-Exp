## Output

One example of our code's output as follows:
```text
[Time] build differential functions cost: 21 ms
Differential functions Size: 24
[ShardSize]: 1000
[PLIs] build PLIs cost: 35ms
  [CLUE] max base in clue: 10800
  [ISN] task count: 1
[ISN] build cost: 925 ms
[ISN] # ISN size: 2118
[DifferentialSet] build ISN and differential set cost: 933 ms
[Diff-cal] time(ns): 722354444
[Minimize TIME]: 4 ms
[Minimize] # before 1321
[Enumeration] cost: 124 ms
[Enumeration] # dds: 330
```
From the beginning of each line of output, you can see the time cost of each part.
